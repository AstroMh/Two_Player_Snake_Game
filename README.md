# Two_Player_Snake_Game
A two player Snake Game which I made by pygame.This was my first complicated project which was coded completely in an object oreinted way.

The Game is simple just try to eat as many coins as possible within two minutes. The twist is where there are two players and only one coin and many other things which try to lower score every time you hit them.

This game is still in development so ignore some bugs and issues you find in it as there are many. The bugs will be fixed soon and there will be many other changes such as a complete starting menu and mystry boxes
